# PipeViewer (pv)

## Summary
```
pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline and modifying its flow. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion. Data flow rate, error handling strategy, buffer size, and cache interaction can all be adjusted.
